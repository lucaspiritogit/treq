Make HTTP requests from your terminal, and save them with an embedded sqlite datababase.

## Where is the DB saved?

Depending on your OS, the sqlite db is saved on these locations:

### Linux / Unix-like

Path: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or ~/.config if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set.
Example: `/home/username/.config`

### Windows

Path: %AppData% (usually `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming`)
Example: `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming`

### macOS

Path: $HOME/Library/Application Support
Example: `/Users/username/Library/Application` Support
